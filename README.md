# Lox  

Interpreter wrote with the guidance of [Crafting interpreter](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). One of the new projects.

## How to use  

Have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.  

Start the repl with: 
```
    cargo run
```
With a file pass the path as the argument: 
```
    cargo run test.lox
```

## Notes  
The `interpreter.rs` and `main.rs` error handling is unfinished.  
More technical debt.
