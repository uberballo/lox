# Lox  

Interpreter wrote with the guidance of [Crafting interpreter](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). One of the new projects.

## How to use  

Have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.  

Start the repl with: 
```
    cargo run
```
With a file pass the path as the argument: 
```
    cargo run test1.lox
```

### List of tests  
* `test1.lox Assign values to variables and handle scopes.`  
* `test2.lox Handle if-cases. *Contains errors, still works*`  
* `test3.lox For-loops.`  
* `test4.lox While-loops. *contains errors, still works*`  
* `test5.lox Functions.`  
* `test6.lox Fibonacci (My favorite).`  
* `test7.lox Assigning functions to variables.`
